Your final "super lab" has been posted to the course web page.  I have set the
due date as noon on Wed 02 May (although our official exam time ends at noon on
    Mon 30 Apr).

I'm calling this a "super lab" because it requires more work than a standard
lab, but you do not have to write any new next-event simulation code.
Specifically, you must:
Use the existing msq function from simEd for experimentation.  (Read Section
    5.2.2.)
Use MOM to fit both the gamma and lognormal distributions to the Tyler's
service data, and then implement the best fitting distribution for a service
function to pass to msq.
Implement a modified version of algorithm 9.3.3 (to be discussed in class
    tomorrow) to provide an interarrival-time function to pass to msq.
Experiment using msq and your interarrival and service functions, investigating
the "best" number of servers to use.  You will need to use the method of batch
means in your output analysis.
So, in short, this "super lab" requires you to do input modeling (on service
    and arrival processes) and then output analysis (batch means), using the
existing msq.

Just make sure to start early enough so you can ask me as you have questions.

P.S.:  Note that, for the MOM derivation for gamma in class on Friday, I did
more work than necessary in the second step of determining estimates for k and
\Theta.  Specifically, I started by considering E(X^2) = Var(X) + E(X)^2 for
both the theoretical and sample, setting k\Theta^2 + (k\Theta)^2 = s^2 +
\bar{x}^2.  We didn't need to include that much -- in this case, we could have
just set k\Theta^2 (the variance for the gamma) equal to s^2 (our sample
    variance) and then solve for \Theta.  The result is the same, as the \bar{x}^2
on both side of the equation from Friday cancel out.


# First moment = E(x^2) 
# Second moment = E(x)^2

# first moment => E(x)^2 = V(x) + E(x)^2
# => V(x) = E(x^2)-E(x)^2
# this means 
# E(x^2) = V(x) + E(x)^2 
#// V(x) = sigma^2 - mu^2

# gamma(k, theta) k=shape, theta=scale
# E(x) => mean = ktheta
# sigma^2 = k(theta^2)

# 1st moment
# ktheta = xbar  (mean(svc))

# 2nd moment
# k(theta^2) + (ktheta)^2 = s^2 (=sd(svc)) + (xbar)^2
# variance + mean

# 1st moment
# ktheta = xbar ==> k = xbar/theta

# now plug k into 2nd moment equation
# k(theta)^2 + (ktheta)^2 = s^2 + (xbar)^2
# (xbar/theta)(theta^2) +
((theta)(xbar/theta))^2 = s^2 + (xbar)^2
# (xbar)theta + (xbar)^2 = s^2 + (xbar)^2
# (xbar)theta = s^2
# theta = (s^2)/xbar

# k = (xbar)/(s^2/xbar)
# k = (xbar^2)/(s^2)

# THUS
# k = (xbar)^2 / (s^2)
# theta = (s^2) / (xbar)
